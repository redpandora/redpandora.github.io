*RedPandorasLisp* is a Linux port of the excellent [uLisp](http://www.ulisp.com) interpreter by David Johnson-Davies.

When developing a personal project with uLisp I had idea of porting the interpreter to Linux so that I could more easily develop and test my code.

The original lisp project ended up not being completed due to size limitations by the current list interpretation technology.

I wish we could store the compiled lisp in flash and run it from there, but even like this I'm not sure of how big and complex lisp microprocessor projects could be.

Let see what the future holds.
