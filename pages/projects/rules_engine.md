Designed and implemented an NRules based rules engine for a customer.
The system is used in the production environment and performs a triage and prioritization of customer outbound messaging using different channels.

NRules is an open source production rules engine for .NET, based on the Rete matching algorithm. Rules are authored in C# using internal DSL.
The rules engine can be downloaded from [https://github.com/NRules/NRules](https://github.com/NRules/NRules)
