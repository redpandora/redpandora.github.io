# WiFi-ToolKit

An IOT (esp8266) embeded Network Analysis and Intrusion Detection System written in pure C with Espressifs IDF and FreeRTOS operating system.

This is an active project consuming practly all my time.

I am not planning to share the source code since I consider it to be a very powerfull and dangerous tool.

This is a tool destined to be used by network engineers and security specialists.

I plan however to release a manual for the toolkit.

At a later stage I will be interested in having it tested in entreprise environments.
